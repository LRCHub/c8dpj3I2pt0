Chapter four
The God-man with the Bible
Was in the back room of the chapel at Fort Whipple
The God-man was deeply engrossed in
Satisfying his goat-lust with a Yavapai girl

She never said a damn thing but just
Leaned over an altar while he defiled her
He held a pistol to her head as he grunted away
And when he was finished, he shoved her towards the outside door

But the God-man never got to fixing
His long-johns or his black trousers
The young man named Blue strode softly up
Behind him and drove a long-bladed knife into his neck

Blood spurted into the chalice on the altar
But not the blood of the Christ
Just the blood of the God-man

With a cough, he died and bubbled gurgle
The young man named Blue took the Yavapai girl
Money, guns, food, two strong horses
And rode into the desert, away from Fort Whipple
The God-man's body was found, but he was not missed
